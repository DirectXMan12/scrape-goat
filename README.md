Scrape :goat:
=============

The Scrape-Goat is a utility for scraping Prometheus metrics in large,
multitenant Kubernetes environments where you need to be able to control
metrics ingestion limits, scrape intervals, etc in a finer manner than the
built-in Prometheus scraping allows.

It's not quite ready for use yet, but see
[sample-config.yaml](sample-config.yaml)
to get an idea of what it can do.
